# FileMiner
I have not experience with fillng "readme.md" files and time to learn Markdown, whats why all information placed in FileMiner API.pdf
Short annotation for executed work.
It was my first experience with proggramming on PHP and PYTHON, whats why result are not so impressive.
Some days i lost for learning PHP and trying to make job on it. But after i decide to use python.
In my first plans was to create job with database wich can control security login access, directories and file access control, but because of spend a lot of time for choosing develop and test platform i hadn't enought time.
Thanks for your attention.
